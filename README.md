# Streamlit Multiline to One Line Converter

## Overview

This Streamlit web application is designed to simplify the process of transforming multiline strings into a single line. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for users to input multiline text and receive the equivalent one-line string as output.

## Features

- **Input Multiline Text:** Users can paste or type multiline strings into the input text area.

- **Convert to One Line:** The app processes the multiline input and generates the corresponding one-line string.

- **Copy to Clipboard:** A convenient "Copy to Clipboard" button allows users to easily copy the transformed one-line string.
